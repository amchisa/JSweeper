# Minesweeper
This project has been my personal attempt at creating a minesweeper clone which is faithful to the original from my experience playing over the years. 

## Description
Minesweeper is a game where you are tasked with clearing out an area full of randomly placed bombs using the information given to you by the game board. My version of this game includes various quality of life features, such as an included help manual, a suite of various status icons based on your current actions, and a integrated debug mode, which can be toggled in game, as well as many other features that are notably lacking from popular browser versions of this game. 

## Additional information
This game requires the latest version of google chrome to function as intended. While I planned to include support for a wider range of browsers, I cannot guarantee that this game will function as intended on other browsers, which is due to a lack of development time (this game was completed as a final project for one of my courses). 

If, while playing you encounter a bug that cannot be fixed by reloading the page, toggling the debug mode in the game settings will allow you to see a report of what the program is computing at any time during your gameplay as well as any errors that are occuring. Please let me know about any problems with the game, and when doing so, please include the associated error message so I can better recreate your issue. I will  tyr my best to fix any user-reported bugs/errors in the next version(s).
